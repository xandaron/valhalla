# Valhalla Graphics Engine

Valhalla is a graphics engine designed for rendering 3D scenes with a focus on non-photorealistic rendering techniques. This project aims to serve as the renderer for a future game engine.

## Features

- Basic 3D scene rendering
- Customizable rendering settings
- Support for OBJ and FBX file formats
- Support for rigged 3D models and animations
- Support for multiple light sources
- Custom shaders
- Shadow mapping
- Real-time rendering
- Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux)
- Integration with Vulkan API

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Odin programming language
  - Install Odin from [here](https://odin-lang.org/docs/install/)
- VulkanSDK (recommended for development)
  - Install VulkanSDK from [here](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/) to use validation layers

### Setup

Run the following script to clone the repository, build the project and run the exe:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/xandaron/valhalla.git
cd valhalla
odin build . -out:build/build.exe
./build/build.exe
```

> **Note:** On Linux, you will need to install the GLFW 3.4+ library separately. It's important you install GLFW 3.4 or later as anything earlier will cause crashes.

## Demo

*The RGB Bunny Box showcases a rendered scene of the Stanford bunny inside a box, lit by Red, Green, and Blue point lights rotating around the Y-axis.*

![GUI Demo](demo/GUI_Demo.gif)

*A demo of imgui in action.*

![Rigged Zombie](demo/Zombie_Walking.gif)

*A demo of a rigged 3D model and animation.*

![CMY Bunny](demo/CMY_Bunny.gif)

*The CMY Bunny demonstrates a rendered scene of the Stanford bunny illuminated by rotating Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow point lights around the Z-axis.*

## Roadmap

- [X] Implement basic rendering pipeline
- [X] Implement basic lighting
- [X] Implement shadow mapping
- [X] Fully featured GUI with scene save, load and editing with runtime asset import
- [ ] HDR support
- [ ] Raytracer
- [ ] Add precompute step
- [ ] Implement my own file dialog (ImFileDialog is great but I have issues with it)
